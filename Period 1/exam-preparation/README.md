# Explain and Reflect

###### <u>Explain differences between Java and JavaScript. You should include both topics related to the fact that Java is a compiled language and JavaScript a scripted language, and general differences in language features.</u>

First of all there is still some similarities. They are both able to do OOP, Object Oriented Programming. 

Let's then go to the differences. Java is a compiled language, which means the code needs to be compiled before it can run.

JavaScript is a scripted functional coding language, that is ready for running the minute you have the js files.

About single programs for a desktop computer javascript are only able to run in the browser or a program built on a browser engine installed on that computer. Java is able to install and run as a independent program. 

About how the language is working, in my opinion, JavaScript's main benefit is that it can be understood by the common human. It is much easier and more robust than Java. It allows for fast creation of web page events. Many JavaScript commands are what are known as Event Handlers: They can be embedded right into existing HTML commands. JavaScript is a little more forgiving than Java. It allows more freedom in the creation of objects. Java is very rigid and requires all items to be denoted and spelled out.

###### <u>Explain the two strategies for improving JavaScript: ES6 (es2015) + ES7, versus Typescript. What does it require to use these technologies: In our backend with Node, in (many different) Browsers</u>

TypeScript set out to solve the problems, when browser compatibility becomes the stopping problem in a particular program. The way it works is making code self explanatory through type definitions on variables. Therefore less or even maybe zero documentation is nescessary for other developers needing in future review/use of your code. Also when having to continue on your code, or even in need to use som public classes of you JavaScript code.

TypeScript then transpiles into a "All Browser" JavaScript, but with no types on as JavaScript in ES5 doesn't have it.

ES2015 offers some modern features like classes and promises, but it  falls short of fully addressing real world development concerns like avoid callbacks, debugging and error handling challenges brought upon by nested code, and still leaving developers to work with a transpiler to reach the widest audience possible. TypeScript is a remarkable piece of technology, offering a world-class integrated development experience. The free and cross-platform Visual Studio Code editor is the icing on the cake.
