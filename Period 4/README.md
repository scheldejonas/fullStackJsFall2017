### React Native with GraphQL

- Explain the concept of the 1-2-3  problem (you need to check the slides for this phrase)
  - The problem states that an app, is best served if you look on the full scale of performance and design, to be the native code running. The problem then comes, with developers needing to be able to code on all three platforms equaly good, and that can be a challenge.
  - The concept, came out of a large number of companies, trying to solve the 1-2-3 problem through hybrid apps, with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. But as FaceBook mentions, it just doesn't get the job done good enough.
- Explain some of the benefits App-development gets by using JavaScriptExplain the topics React, React Native and Expo and how they are connected
- Explain the concept of "Write Once, Run anywhere" and "Learn once, Use Anywhere"
- Explain the Pros & Cons of using Hybrid/HTML5 - Mobile App apps compared to Native apps
- Demonstrate, with a live example + code, how we interact with features like camera, location, ImagePicker, video and more with React Native and Expo
- Demonstrate, using a live example, how we can debug a React Native App, without the need to install either XCode or the Android SDK.
- Explain, using a working Example, the basic building blocks in a React Native/Expo application
- Demonstrate using a working example, how a React Native/Expo app can communicate with a backend. Also, either demonstrate or explain, how we can expose our localhost servers to “the outside world” while we are developing.**
