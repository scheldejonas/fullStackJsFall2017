### ES6 Promises

- Explain about promises in ES6 including, the problems they solve, a quick explanation of the Promise API.

Promises is solving our big callback hell, to the extend of developers not fully understanding the long trail of functions needed to be done in one shoot before html page is for example ready in the browser.

Promises is the way to code, we want this to happen within an parallel time used for the rest of the code.

Promises is the option to set example a ajax call to start, and serve through a .then() function, when the data has been received from the ajax call.

- Example(s) that demonstrate how to avoid the callback hell  (“Pyramid of Doom")

[Callback Hell demonstration and avoidance](callback_hell.md) 

- Example(s) that demonstrate how to execute asynchronous code in serial or parallel



- Example(s) that demonstrate how to implement our own promise-solutions.
- Example(s) that demonstrate error handling with promises

### ES7 async-functions

- Explain about JavaScripts async/await, how it relates to promises and reasons to use it compared to the plain promise API.
  - Provide examples to demonstrate
  - Why this often is the preferred way of handling promises
  - Error handling with async/await
  - Serial or parallel execution with async/await.


### React state through Redux

- Explain the concept of state in relation to programming generally, web-applications and React
- Explain about  “plain state handling” in React using Props and State
- Explain about MobX, and Redux and why/when such libraries makes sense.
- Explain, using a simple example how to use Redux. Include the following concepts:
  - Immuatbility
  - Single source of truth
  - Actions and Reducers
  - How to use Redux with React
- Explain and demonstrate tools to debug Redux applications, including the concept Time Traveling
